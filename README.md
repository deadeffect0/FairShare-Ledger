# FairShare Ledger
 The "FairShare Ledger" project implements a system to efficiently settle debts among a group of individuals. It calculates each person's net balance and uses data structures like maps and multisets to determine the minimum number of transactions required to clear all debts. By identifying the most significant creditors and debtors, the algorithm matches them to minimize the total number of payments. This approach ensures an optimal and streamlined settlement process, reducing the complexity of multiple individual transactions.
